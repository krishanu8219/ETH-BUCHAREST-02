# ArbiProof Business Model

## Executive Summary

ArbiProof is a gas-efficient fraud proof system built on Arbitrum Stylus that enables secure, cost-effective dispute resolution for optimistic rollups and layer 2 solutions. By leveraging Rust's performance advantages through Stylus, ArbiProof delivers up to 70% gas savings compared to Solidity implementations, making complex dispute resolution economically viable.

## Market Need

1. **Cost Barrier**: Traditional fraud proof systems on Ethereum are prohibitively expensive, with simple disputes costing upwards of $100 in gas fees.
   
2. **Technical Complexity**: Implementing secure fraud proof systems is challenging, with many Layer 2 projects struggling to create reliable verification mechanisms.

3. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: As L2 adoption grows, efficient dispute resolution becomes critical for maintaining network integrity and user trust.

4. **Interoperability Challenges**: Existing solutions often create walled gardens with limited integration capabilities.

## Value Proposition

ArbiProof delivers:

1. **70%+ Gas Savings**: Our benchmarks demonstrate significant gas savings across all operations, from dispute initiation (50% savings) to complex cryptographic verifications (85% savings).

2. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Built with Rust's memory safety guarantees and leveraging battle-tested cryptographic libraries.

3. **Seamless Integration**: Full EVM compatibility allows ArbiProof to integrate with existing smart contract infrastructure.

4. **Expandable Framework**: Modular design supports various verification types from simple state transitions to complex ZK-proof validations.
