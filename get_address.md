# How to Get Your Ethereum Wallet Address

Your private key is generated and saved in `private_key.txt`, but you need the wallet address to receive test ETH. Here are several ways to get your wallet address:

## Option 1: Using a web tool (simplest, but less secure)

1. Go to https://privatekey.io/ or https://allprivatekeys.com/private-key-to-address
2. Enter your private key from `private_key.txt`
3. Get your wallet address

## Option 2: Using Node.js (more secure)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install ethers
   ```

2. Create a file called `address.js` with this content:
   ```javascript
   const { Wallet } = require('ethers');
   
   // Read the private key from file
   const fs = require('fs');
   const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('./private_key.txt', 'utf8').trim();
   
   // Create wallet
   const wallet = new Wallet('0x' + privateKey);
   
   // Print address
   console.log('Your wallet address:', wallet.address);
   ```

3. Run it:
   ```
   node address.js
   ```

## Option 3: Using MetaMask (user-friendly)

1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Open MetaMask and click "Import Account"
3. Paste your private key from `private_key.txt`
4. Your wallet address will be shown at the top of the MetaMask interface
