# ArbiProof Business Plan

## Executive Summary

ArbiProof is a gas-efficiency simulation dashboard and smart contract suite built on Arbitrum Stylus. It demonstrates the significant gas savings achievable when using Rust-based Stylus contracts compared to traditional Solidity implementations.

## Product Overview

### ArbiProof Gas-Efficiency Simulator Dashboard on Arbitrum Stylus

ArbiProof is a solution for gas-efficient fraud proofs on Arbitrum Stylus. It compares gas usage across Stylus and Solidity implementations.

### What is ArbiProof?

ArbiProof is a simulation dashboard and smart contract suite. It shows how Arbitrum Stylus reduces gas costs for fraud proofs, cryptographic operations, and supply chain verification. It includes a deployed Stylus contract on Arbitrum Sepolia.

### Why ArbiProof? (Market Problem)

- **Fraud Proofs are costly**: Solidity-based proofs are gas-intensive
- **High Barriers to Entry**: Complex protocols are hard to understand and test
- **No Visual Benchmarking Tools**: Developers lack real-time dashboards
- **Expensive On-chain Verification**: Gas costs inhibit innovation

## Technical Features

### Stylus vs Solidity - Benchmarking Dashboard

- Live comparison of gas usage (Stylus vs Solidity)
- Benchmarks for:
  - ZK verification (Matrix ops)
  - State transitions
  - Hashing
  - Supply chain validation
- Historical trends of gas efficiency
- **75% Gas Savings** in all categories

### What's Under the Hood?

- **Rust for Stylus**: Core logic written in Rust
- **WASM Execution**: Compiled to WebAssembly
- **Stylus Runtime**: Uses Arbitrum's runtime
- **Dispute System**: Built-in staking, bisection
- **ZK Verification Simulation**: Runs cryptographic matrix operations
- **Benchmarking Functions**: Measure gas used
- **Supply Chain Validation**: Validates product checkpoints
- **Interoperability**: Acts as a computational engine

## Market Application

### Real-World Use Cases

- Fraud Proofs for Layer 2s
- ZK Verification at lower costs
- Supply Chain Tracking
- DeFi Risk Modelling
- Cross-chain Messaging & Oracles

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**Dashboard Tiers**
- Free
- Dev: $50/mo
- Enterprise: $500/mo

**Protocol Integration**
- $5K-$50K setup + 0.5% rev share

**Consulting**
- $250/hr, custom dev $10K+

### Competitive Edge

- **75%+ cheaper operations** vs Solidity
- Handles ZK and cryptographic ops inside the EVM
- Stylus + Rust = High performance + safety
- Only product offering live benchmarking for devs

### Roadmap

1. **Now**: Proof of Concept on Sepolia
2. **3 Months**: Launch beta dashboard, release JS SDK, onboard 5 paying users
3. **6 Months**: Launch certification, integrate with more L2s, $10K MRR target
